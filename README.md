# Highschool_projects
Some projects in C++ and C# made during highschool, specifically in the 11th grade during the pandemic.

1. "The Cube" game is developed in Unity, written in C#. It is based on youtube tutorials
and ultimately became my "certificate in Computer Science" (atestat) project.

"Playable cube" contains the necessary files for playing.
"Complete cube" contains all the actual code and assets.

Controls: WASD for moving, P or space bar for pausing and resuming.
There are 5 levels and the user has to reach the finish line. If an object is hit, the level restarts.

2. The "Razboi egiptean" project is the equivalent of "Egyptian Rat Screw" and its puropse was to
have a go with linked lists. Each press of any button shows either one player's hand or the table.

3. "Sudoku Backtracking" project takes input from a file where a solvable grid is put, having 0 for blanks.
It does exactly what the title says.
